Marketing country and western acts in Europe can be a problem,
so an alternative "International Radio Mix" was created for the
release of this song across the Atlantic. This country-lite mix
retained the banjo plucking from the originally version but added
a bassline, drums and an electric guitar solo to make it more
palatable to European ears. The tactic worked in the UK, as this
song became Swift's first British hit.
